<p align="center">A relatively ottermatic (automatic) CRUD backend administration panel</p>

# Introduction
Otter was created as an open-source alternative to Laravel Nova. The backend administration panel is built with the beautiful tabler template and follows the structure of the popular laravel extension packages like horizon and telescope.

Otter is designed to handle almost everything for you through `OtterResource` files that essentially tie to your Eloquent Models.

# Installation

Install Otter with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md):

```bash
$ composer require poowf/otter
```

> In Laravel 5.5+, [service providers and aliases are automatically registered](https://laravel.com/docs/packages#package-discovery). If you're using Laravel 5.5+, skip ahead directly to step 2.

Once the composer installation completes, all you need to do is add the service provider. Open `config/app.php`, and make the following changes:

1) Add a new item to the `providers` array:

    ```php
    Poowf\Otter\OtterServiceProvider::class,
    ```

2) Install all the relevant Otter assets:
    > If you are updating Otter, run `php artisan otter:publish` instead
    ```bash
    php artisan otter:install
    ```
    
# Usage
Defining the Models to be registered to Otter is very simple. Let's create an `OtterResource` by running the following command:
```bash
php artisan otter:resource User
``` 
> You may specify a model class name with the `--model` argument

This will generate a `OtterResource` file located in `app/Otter`.

# OtterResource Conventions
This is an example of an `OtterResource` that is generated by the `otter:resource` command, which will be automatically registered by Otter.
```php
<?php

namespace App\Otter;

use Poowf\Otter\Http\Resources\OtterResource;

class User extends OtterResource
{
    //
}
```

## Model
The `$model` variable is where we define the Eloquent Model that the `OtterResource` is responsible for.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Otter;

use Poowf\Otter\Http\Resources\OtterResource;

class User extends OtterResource
{
    /**
     * The model the resource corresponds to.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public static $model = 'App\User';
}
```

## Fields
The `fields` function will return a key value pair of the available columns that you would like to control in the Otter.
They key is the name of the column in the model, and the value is the type of the input.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Otter;

use Poowf\Otter\Http\Resources\OtterResource;

class User extends OtterResource
{
    /**
     * Get the fields and types used by the resource
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        return [
            'name' => 'text',
            'password' => 'password',
            'email' => 'email',
        ];
    }
}
```

You can hide certain fields in the index and single view resources by defining a `hidden` function returning an array of the keys that you would like hidden. An example configuration would be to hide the password field for a User.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Otter;

use Poowf\Otter\Http\Resources\OtterResource;

class User extends OtterResource
{
    /**
     * Fields to be hidden in the resource collection
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function hidden()
    {
        return [
            'password'
        ];
    }
}
```

## Validation
When creating or updating the resources in storage, you should add some validation rules to ensure that the data is stored correctly. You can do this for both the client and server side by defining a `validations` method in the `OtterResource`. The below example has defined rules for both the client and server side for the create and updated methods.
The client side is utilising VeeValidate for validation so please see the available rules at the [VeeValidate Rules Documentation](https://baianat.github.io/vee-validate/guide/rules.html). The server side is utilising the default [Laravel Validation Rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules).

```php
/**
 * Get the validation rules used by the resource
 *
 * @return array
 */
public static function validations()
{
    return [
        'client' => [
            'create' => [
                'name' => 'required|min:4',
                'email' => 'required|email',
                'password' => 'required',
            ],
            'update' => [
                'name' => 'required|min:4',
                'email' => 'required|email',
                'password' => '',
            ]
        ],
        'server' => [
            'create' => [
                'name' => 'required|min:4',
                'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',
                'password' => 'required',
            ],
            'update' => [
                'name' => 'required|string|min:4',
                'email' => 'required|email|unique:users,email,' . auth()->user()->id,
                'password' => 'required',
            ]
        ],
    ];
}
```

## Relationships

Otter has partial support for Eloquent relationships. You have to define your relationships in the `OtterResource` file and define the Relationship `method name` as the key and the `OtterResource` class name that links to the relationship.
 
You can also define a custom foreign key if you are not using the Laravel defaults.

The `title` property should be the column of the model that will be displayed in the options list during editing/creating of new resources .

```php
<?php

namespace App\Otter;

use Poowf\Otter\Http\Resources\OtterResource;

class User extends OtterResource
{
    /**
     * The column of the model to display in select options
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public static $title = 'name';
        
    /**
     * Get the relations used by the resource
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function relations()
    {
        return [
            'company' => ['Company', 'company_id'],
            'company' => 'Company',
        ];
    }
}
```

# Authorization
Otter exposes a dashboard at `/otter`. By default, you will only be able to access this dashboard in the local environment. Within your `app/Providers/OtterServiceProvider.php` file, there is a gate method. This authorization gate controls access to Otter in non-local environments. You are free to modify this gate as needed to restrict access to your Otter installation:

```php
/**
 * Register the Otter gate.
 *
 * This gate determines who can access Otter in non-local environments.
 *
 * @return void
 */
protected function gate()
{
    Gate::define('viewOtter', function ($user) {
        return in_array($user->email, [
            'zane@poowf.com'
        ]);
    });
}
```

# Configuration
After publishing Otter's assets, its primary configuration file will be located at `config/otter.php`. 

This configuration file will allow you to configure the middleware for both the `api` and `web` routes that is automatically registered by Otter. 

You can also configure the keys of the `Auth::user()` instance for the `name` and `email` properties that is used in the top right dropdown. 

The `pagination` configuration value is used to display the number of records in the index pages.
```php
'middleware.web' => ['web'],
'middleware.api' => ['api'],

'pagination' => 20,

'user' => [
    'name' => 'name',
    'email' => 'email',
],
```

# Extras
A dark/night theme can be enabled by specifying `Otter::night()` in the boot method of the OtterServiceProvider
